### Auto-Skip Youtube Ads

### Auto scroll through webtoons
Run `webtoon-auto-scroller.py` locally and click on the webtoon you wish to auto-scroll immediately. Autoscrolling continues even when you click next chapter. Usually, for webtoons having chapter lengths similar to Purple Hyacinth, we can go through 3-4 chapters in a single iteration of code. Currently, I am debating whether I should change it to infinite scrolling, with code abortion using a FAIL-SAFE method (take your cursor to the corner of your screen to stop auto-scrolling). 

### Spiral Painter
